# Mexican restaurant 

This is a basic react app built using create-react-app. The app depicts a mexican themed restaurant that allowed me to practice rendering different react components
to the screen i.e. Menu food items, user form, general information etc. Each component is rendered according to which menu option is selected in the user interface.
